# Description

Vagrantfile to create a three-VM EMC ScaleIO lab setup, with Flocker build from source, on CentOS 7

# Usage

*Tested with Vagrant 1.7.2

Get the source
```
git clone https://github.com/wallnerryan/scaleio-flocker

cd scaleio-flocker
```

Copy the RPMS into the source directory
```
cp EMC-ScaleIO-callhome-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm E MC-ScaleIO-sdc-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm
EMC-ScaleIO-gateway-1.31-243.0.noarch.rpm  EMC-ScaleIO-sds-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm
EMC-ScaleIO-gui-1.31-243.0.noarch.rpm  EMC-ScaleIO-tb-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm
EMC-ScaleIO-lia-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm EMC-ScaleIO-mdm-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

Copy the certs (if needed) into source/certs
```
cp EMCSSL.crt EMCCA.crt certs/
```

Install Vagrant Reload Provisioner 
```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
```

# Start vagrant
```
vagrant up
```

# Tested

With CentOS 7, ZFS, ScaleIO Integration with Flocker Public Git Source


# Examples

Your 3 Nodes containing ScaleIO + Flocker will be on a private address space
in virtualbox. The example at the time of running this used vboxnet1 192.168.50.1/24

The plugin (https://github.com/emccorp/scaleio-flocker-driver) should come installed in this
environment, as well as cluster certificates.
```
version: 1
control-service:
  hostname: "control-service"
dataset:
  backend: "scaleio_flocker_driver"
  username: "admin"
  password: "Scaleio123"
  mdm: "192.168.50.12"
  protection_domain: "pdomain"
  ssl: True
```

Here is a fig file (mongo-application.yml) (you can find this in this repo as well under ./examples)

```
"version": 1
"applications":
  "mongodbserver":
    "image": "clusterhq/mongodb"
    "volume":
      "mountpoint": "/data/db"
      "maximum_size": "8589934592"
    "ports":
    - "internal": 27017
      "external": 27017
  "mongodbconn":
    "image": "wallnerryan/mongoconn"
    "ports":
    - "internal": 8080
      "external": 8080
```

Here is a deployment file (mongo-deployment-1node.yml)

```
"version": 1
"nodes":
 "192.168.50.11": ["mongodbserver", "mongodbconn"]
 "192.168.50.12": []
 "192.168.50.13": []
```

Run the example
```
flocker-deploy mongo-deployment-1node.yml mongo-application.yml 
```

**You should be able to see the volumes on the node (tb == 192.168.50.11)**
```
[root@tb flocker-emc]# /bin/emc/scaleio/drv_cfg --query_vols
Retrieved 1 volume(s)
VOL-ID aea92e8700000000 MDM-ID 62a34bc20b360b1c
```

You should be able go to a web browser 192.168.50.11:8080 and see the app is connected to MongoDB 

![Alt text](/examples/connected.png?raw=true)

Also view the containers on the node (Image shows 192.168.50.11)

![Alt text](/examples/bothcontainers.png?raw=true)

Here is a deployment file (mongo-deployment-2node.yml)

```
"version": 1
"nodes":
 "192.168.50.11": ["mongodbconn"]
 "192.168.50.12": ["mongodbserver"]
 "192.168.50.13": []
```

Run the example to move the app
```
flocker-deploy mongo-deployment-2node.yml mongo-application.yml 
```

You should be able go to a web browser 192.168.50.11:8080 and see the app is NOT connected to MongoDB while MongoDB is moving, this is temporary, you may look at the log to see the connection status for ```flocker--mongodbconn```

![Alt text](/examples/cannot_connect.png?raw=true)

You should see 1 container on each host after the ```mongodbserver``` is migrated.

(Image shows 192.168.50.11)

![Alt text](/examples/mongoconnonly.png?raw=true)

(Image shows 192.168.50.12)

![Alt text](/examples/mongodbonly.png?raw=true)

After the mongodbserver is succesfully migrated, You should be able go to a web browser 192.168.50.11:8080 and see the app is again connected to MongoDB.

You should also see the volume has moved to the new host.

**You should be able to see the volumes on the node (mdm1 == 192.168.50.12)**
```
[root@mdm1 flocker-emc]# /bin/emc/scaleio/drv_cfg --query_vols
Retrieved 1 volume(s)
VOL-ID aea92e8700000000 MDM-ID 62a34bc20b360b1c
```

# Cluster

Each node in the cluster will house the ScaleIO tooling, SDC/SDS for
volume access, Docker and Flocker in the above example, you can see this
sshing into any node and follow the below

```
vagrant ssh <tb|mdm1|mdm2>

```

```
[vagrant@tb ~]$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

```

# REST API

We can test the Gateway REST API for scaleio in this environment as well. Follow
the below instructions to do so.

Get the rest api test source and enter the directory (not public yet, EMC network only)

```
git clone https://git.lss.emc.com/scm/floc/scaleio-rest.git
cd scaleio-rest
```

Next, set the IP of mdm1 to an environment var
then we need to run a login, then thet tests

```
export SERVERIP="192.168.50.12"
python test/login.py 
INFO:rest_tests:ScaleIO request: https://192.168.50.12:443/api/login
INFO:urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTPS connection (1): 192.168.50.12
INFO:rest_tests:Login response: "YWRtaW46MTQyNzk5NzMyMTY3MDplYjEzZTZkOGYyZTBkZmQ2N2Y1YmEwMGMyZWIwYWFmNw"

Now run: export SCALEIOPASS="YWRtaW46MTQyNzk5NzMyMTY3MDplYjEzZTZkOGYyZTBkZmQ2N2Y1YmEwMGMyZWIwYWFmNw"

```

As it says, export the new password

```
export SCALEIOPASS="YWRtaW46MTQyNzk5NzMyMTY3MDplYjEzZTZkOGYyZTBkZmQ2N2Y1YmEwMGMyZWIwYWFmNw"
```

Now we can run the tests

```

# Caveats

Working with vagrant's insecure private key working correctly, flocker-deploy should
not ask for a password as long as you run the below command from you CLI node

```
[ -e "${SSH_AUTH_SOCK}" ] || eval $(ssh-agent) && ssh-add ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
```

Test that this is working correctly against the tb node.
(It should response unknown because we built flocker-node from source?)
```
you@yourmachine:~ ssh root@192.168.50.11 flocker-reportstate --version
unknown
```
